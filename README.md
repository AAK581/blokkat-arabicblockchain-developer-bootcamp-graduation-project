# About this project

## Project Description
Sepolia Cats is a gamified Sepolia Ethereum faucet made on top of the Scroll L2 network.
Users can claim Scroll Sepolia ETH by collecting kittens in the Scroll Sepolia game which can be synced online using the Teleporter
in-game item.
Upon collecting at least 15 kittens, a user can claim a reward from the dApp, with a maximum of 4 rewards per day.
The game was made using RPG Maker MZ, the dApp was made using a React app using Reown Appkit and Wagmi, and the smart contract was tested
using Foundry.
